1. what do code contracts do ?
<ol type="a" align="justify">
<li> The contain data structures for a group of related functionalities that a class or a struct can implement</li>
<li> They provide a way to specify preconditions, postconditions, and object invariants in your code</li>
<li> They are data structures that can operate on demand per requirements</li>
<li> They contain definitions for a group of related functionalities that a class or a struct can implement</li></ol>

2. Why would you use ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation ?
<ol type="a" align="justify">
  <li> You have little memory and disk space</li>
<li> you can deliver a faster startup time, especially in big applications where much code executes on startup</li>
  <li> you have a slow processor</li>
  <li> the JIT compiler does not have to do a lot of disk I/O actions, which are quite expensive</li></ol>

  <ol type="a" align="justify">
<li>a contructor can use a base statement and a this statement if the base statement comes first</li>
  <li>the this keyword lets a constructor call a different contructor in the same class</li>
  <li>  a contructor can use one this statement at most</li>
<li> if a constructor uses a this statement, its code is executed after the invoked contructor is executed</li></ol>

5. The ASP.NET Core Module is a native IIS module that plugs into the IIS pipeline to either
<ol type="a" align="justify">
<li>package up your c# applications and C# packaged into .NET modules, or specify which of its packages should be visible to other .NET modules</li>
<li>create IIS code the server needs in a file with the extension required, or run the IIS server in a mode compatible for ASP.NET Core</li>
<li>host an ASP.NET Core app inside of the IIS worker process, called the out-of-process hosting model or forward web request to a backend ASP.NET Core app running the kestrel server, called the in process hosting model</li>
<li>  host an ASP.Net core app inside of the IIS worker process, called the in process hosting model or forward web requests to a backend ASP.NET Core app running the kestrel server, called the out of process hosting model</li></ol>

6. What is .NET?
<ol type="a" align="justify">
<li>.NET is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language, its language contructs an object-oriented approach aimed at helping programmers write clear; logical code for small and large-scle projects</li>
<li>.NET is a general-purpose programming language. The language has expanded significantly over time, and now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation</li>
<li>.NET is a free, cross platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications with multiple languages, editors, and libraries for web, mobile, desktop, gaming and IoT</li>
<li>.NET is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run programs written in several languages and compile programs to bytecode</li> </ol>

7. Why would the .NET framework use normal-JIT (Just-in-time)  
  <ol type="a" align="justify">
<li>to compile only the methods that are called at run time and them from memory after execution </li>
<li>to compile complete source code into native code in a single complitation cycle during deployment of the application</li>
<li>to compile only the methods that are called at run time and then store them in cache for one minute</li>
<li>to compile only methods called at run time which are compiled the forst time methods are called and then stored in cache to be used for execution when the same methods are called again</li></ol>
